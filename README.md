# android_packages_apps_Jelly-prebuilt
Jelly (unsigned) apk as prebuilt from LineageOS/packages_apps_Jelly (cm-14.1)

This is from **LineageOS/packages_apps-Jelly** (cm-14.1 branch), the unsigned 
APK has been built by the command *'gradlew assembleBuild'* within that repo
and uploaded here. 

The apk file can't be directly side loaded and installed, it will be included and signed during the 
build process. **The purpose of this repository is the use of Jelly in cm-13.0 builds**

All credits go to the Lineage OS project (I've only assembled the unsigned apk file here)
